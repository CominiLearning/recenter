A browser extension to help focus on what needs to be done and motivate you to get there

Two ways to install this:
1) Clone this repo (which allows you get updates easily)
2) Download the dist file

Go to chrome://extensions in your Chrome browser,
Toggle on the developer mode at the top right.
Click the "Load unpacked" button and install it (by uploading the dist folder).

That's it.
